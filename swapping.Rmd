It is interesting to note that the indexes with the highest percent of swapping were `TATGGCAC_TGTTCCGT`, accounting for 26 and 28 percent of the swapped indexed. Further research will look at the differences in indices, and if some indices should be discontinued because of their high degree of swapping.
